For non-HTTP vulnerabilities such as TCP, or when nothing was captured or there is no exact match, omit it or pass [], keep other verifiable evidence such as command output and logs in evidence, and it is advisable to explain why nothing was bound. Do not guess IDs, and do not re-probe just to capture packets."
